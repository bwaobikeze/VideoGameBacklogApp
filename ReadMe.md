## Known issues
- To view a screenshot in the game detail view, you need to click on the initial image first, navigate back to the game description screen, and then click on a different image for it to function properly.
- Upon initially visiting the game catalog, navigating back to that tab triggers the regeneration of games, resulting in duplicates of the same game. To resolve this issue, simply click on the recommended tab and then return to the game catalog tab to rectify the duplication.
